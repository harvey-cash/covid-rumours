But the report did not recommend buying 16,000 ventilators, and did not indicate whether the state was at a fiscal position to purchase them. The state did not plan to increase its ventilator stockpile because it anticipated that in the event of a severe crisis, there would be shortage of trained staff to operate them and demand would outweigh any emergency stockpile. The report said the state had to balance the likely ventilator shortage with the need for adequate funding for current and ongoing health care expenses.",

Upon entering the body, the virus attaches to and enters cells in the airway where it takes over the cells’ machinery, producing more viral particles that spread to other cells. Because the virus hides out in the body’s own cells, it can not be targeted without also killing healthy, uninfected cells. Therefore, fighting viral infections relies on the body’s immune response.",

A runny nose, sputum, dry cough and pneumonia can be symptoms of COVID-19 however not everyone infected with the disease will have them. Disease expert Prof Collignon says temperatures around 26 to 27 degrees C won't kill the virus however UV light from the sun can be effective in drying out the virus. Understanding of how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces is limited, with the WHO referring to previous studies of other viruses to estimate a range of a few hours to a few days. Drinking warm water, avoiding iced drinks and gargling warm salt water are not treatments or preventions, according to Prof Cunningham, however staying hydrated is important and gargling may relieve sore throats. The timeline for progression of COVID-19 symptoms is partly accurate but not everyone will experience all of these symptoms or in that order. Prof Cunningham also said it was not accurate to say infection will happen first in the throat, as the delicate tissues behind the nose are more likely starting points.",
